            <p>Masters of mechanical mayhem, engineers love to tinker with explosives, elixirs, and all manner of hazardous gadgets. They can take control of an area by placing turrets, support their allies with alchemical weaponry, or lay waste to foes with a wide array of mines, bombs, and grenades.</p>

            <h4>CREATING AN ENGINEER</h4>
            <p>When creating an engineer, think about how your character learned the skills needed to work with machines. Did they teach themselves? Or were they trained by a guild or society of engineers? Perhaps they come from a culture like that of dwarves and gnomes where such skills are common. Or perhaps they just figured it out for themselves through experimentation.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the engineer’s background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an engineer, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">

                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st</li>

When you level up, you may choose to replace a gadget you possess and replace it with one gadget for which you meet the requirements. The old gadget is destroyed, and you must craft the new one. If a gadget is somehow damaged, you must repair it with an Intelligence (Tinker’s tools) check with a DC = 12 + Gadget Tier, spending half of the cost and time to repair it. A gadget lost or destroyed must be replaced entirely.

                <p>At the 3rd level, you gain the ability to create potions. Potions (or Poisons) require one {{infuse-potion:action}} to apply, consume or throw. A successful check with the appropriate tools is required to make a brew. A failure results in a less potent or random failed concoction (DM’s discretion). An exceptional or critical success may result in a more potent or duplicate brew, free of costs (also DM’s discretion). Potions that use your statistics in their description use your statistics at the time of brewing. Keep track of the number upon brewing.

            <p>A two-handed weapon that can sear foes and create smokescreens, manipulating the battlefield in interesting ways.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fireblast.</em></strong> As an action, shoot a blazing stream of fire. You project a 40ft long line of fire, making a ranged attack roll against each creature in it, dealing 1d6 + Intelligence fire damage on a hit. This deals 2d6 at level 5, 3d6 at level 9, 4d6 at level 13 and 5d6 at level 17. The attack roll uses Dexterity.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Napalm Spread.</em></strong> As an action, force all creatures within a 15ft cone to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d6 fire damage. A creature takes half damage on a success. You can spend more energy to deal an additional 1d6 fire per point spent, up to 3 energy.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Smokescreen.</em></strong> As a bonus action, and for 1 energy, exhaust smoke from your flamethrower. A 10ft-radius sphere centered around yourself is filled with smoke for 2 rounds, heavily obscuring the area for all creatures except you.</p>

            <p>A device that functions as a regular quarterstaff, but can also deliver a powerful arcane attack. Additionally, when you make a tinker’s tool check to build or repair something, you add a +2 bonus to the roll while in possession of the staff, as it also functions as a tool.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Staff Strike.</em></strong> You make a melee weapon attack with the staff. Treat this as a Quarterstaff attack(one handed:1d6 bludgoning, Two handed 1d8 Bludgoning). Against constructs or mechanical objects, deal an additional 2d6 force damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mend.</em></strong> You can use your staff to cast mending on a damaged simple device made of stone, metal or wood within 10 feet. You may also use this feature, spending 1 energy, to heal a construct (including your drones and turrets) within 10 feet for 1d6 + 1 hit points as a bonus action, as long as the construct has at least 1 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Arcane Ray.</em></strong> As an action, while wielding the staff, you can spend energy to make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 60 feet. On a hit, the creature takes 2d8 force damage + an additional 1d8 force damage per energy point spent (maximum 3 energy). Add your proficiency bonus and Intelligence modifier to attack rolls with this ability.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Magitech Pulse.</em></strong> For 2 Energy, as an action, you can force all creatures (size large and smaller) within 10 feet to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked prone.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mobility Configuration.</em></strong> You can make a melee attack for 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier slashing damage. You also have a taser that can make a creature within 5ft of you to make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned on their next turn. Additionally you may use your bonus action to shoot a grappling hook at a target within 30ft of you and pull yourself toward it. You may also use 1 energy to either make an attack, attempt to grapple them, or attempt to stun them with your taser.</p>

            <p>This mortar must be carried in separate pieces. It can be partially assembled in a round and fully in a minute. It takes the same amount of time to disassemble, and you can’t move or perform any other actions with your hands while it is assembled.</p>
            <p class="indent">While partially assembled, you can spend 2 Energy as an action to replicate the effects of a fireball with a range of 300ft.</p>
            <p class="indent">While fully assembled, you can spend 5 Energy as an action to replicate the effects of a single detonation from a Meteor Swarm. When you do so, attempt an Intelligence check against DC18, poor visibility or weather conditions may cause disadvantage on this roll. Failure means that the detonation happens 1d20X10ft away from your target in a random direction. You can only shoot in this manner once every five rounds.</p>

            <p>This set of specialised tools allows you to create replicas of creatures as per the spell Simulacrum. The result duplicate is actually a construct built from clockwork and fake flesh. This construct is nonmagical and cannot be dispelled. You can spend one energy point to recover one hit point of the construct instead of the usual 100GP. You can also allow it to recover a spell by spending an amount of energy equal to the spell’s level.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the duplicate is active, your max energy is decreased by 7, and you can only have one duplicate active at a time.</p>

            <p><strong>6 Energy.</strong> As an action, your critical hit range increases by 4 for a minute. You must still beat the target’s AC to hit unless you roll a natural 20. You can also see through all visual illusions during this time, and deal 6d6 extra damage on a critical hit. When this minute ends, you become blinded. This blindness cannot be negated or restored by any means, but it ends after a minute.</p>

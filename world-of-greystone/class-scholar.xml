    <description>
      <p>A human general, clad in gleaming armor, studies the map on the table in front of him, covered in figurines that represent units of his soldiers and invading orcs. He consults a leather-bound journal filled with notes he’s made on the enemy’s tribe, their customs and battle tactics, and he moves two pieces confidently forward. </p>
      <p class="indent">Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a halfling tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.</p>
      <p class="indent">A dwarf in fine robes addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape.</p>
      <p class="indent">Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.</p>
      <h4>THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE</h4>
      <p>A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as members of the military.</p>
      <p class="indent">For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A SCHOLAR </h4>
      <p>As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places.</p>
      <p class="indent">Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second choose the Sage background if you plan on following the Physician pursuit, the Noble background if you plan on following the Politician pursuit, or the Soldier background if you plan on following the Tactician pursuit.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to apply your studies in practical ways known as maneuvers. Your maneuvers are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.
        <br/>
        <span class="feature">Maneuvers.</span>You know 2 maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. You may only use a particular maneuver once per turn. Many of your maneuvers enhance an attack in some way, you can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
        <br/>
        <span class="feature">Superiority Dice.</span>You have a number of superiority dice as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Scholar class table which are d6s. This die changes as you gain Scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the Scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
        <br/>
        <span class="feature">Saving Throws.</span>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
        <br/>
        <b>Maneuver save DC</b> = 
        <b>8</b> + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

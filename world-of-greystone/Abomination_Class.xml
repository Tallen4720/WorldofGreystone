    <description>
      <p>A tall human stalks through the darkness, readying his claws to strike.</p>
      <p class="indent">A halfing snarls at the an angry mob as a pair of dark wings sprout from his back.</p>
      <p class="indent">Frothing at the mouth, what was a dwarf slashes at a victim, and prepares for the feast.</p>
      <p class="indent"> Regardless of the story of their creation, abominations are normal people that conatin a dark, feral beast inside them.</p>
      <p class="indent">When their emotions begin to be too much, the beast takes hold, and they transfom into a horrifying being..</p>
      <h4> HUMANITY LOST</h4>
      <p> Due to their curse, Abominations don't stay in one place for too long, for fear of others finding out. Since they can't control the primal urges, they leve humanity behind for everyone's safety.</p>
      <p class="indent">When an abomination gets too stressed, they transform into a hideous beast. Depending on the situation they may control it, but that's never a guarantee.</p>
      <h4>GUARDIAN BEAST</h4>
      <p>Thouagh Abominations like to avoid society, they do usually care for others. In many cases they are able to make friends with normal beings, especially if they knew the Abomination before the curse..</p>
      <p class="indent">If the friend of an Abomination is in danger, the Abomination is more than willing to take any pain to protect them, even if it means revealing their secret.</p>
      <h4>CREATING AN ABOMINATION</h4>
      <p>When creating an abomination character, think about the origin of the curse. Were you scientist that made a mistake? Were you a prisoner who experimented on extensively? Did you anger a witch and she cursed you for life? Either way, Abominations are rearely cursed willingly</p>

              Your manifestation now has a massive mouth running vertically down your chest and stomach, which can be used to make a bite attack as an action that deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage.
                 If the target is a size or more smaller than you and is grappled, on a successful bite, you can swallow the target. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of you, and it takes 3d6 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. If you take 25 damage or more in a single round from the creatures inside of you, then you must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of you.

          <em>Spell Slots.</em>
        </strong> The Divine Puppet Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

      <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Divine Puppet Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

          <em>Spellcasting Ability.</em>
        </strong> Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells, since you have to contain the divine power inside you. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

          <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
